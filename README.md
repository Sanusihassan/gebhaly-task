# Gebhaly Full-Stack Task by Sanusi

This is the code repository for the Gebhaly full-stack task completed by Sanusi. The project uses express.js, MongoDB, and NextJs to create a full-stack application.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the NextJs front-end and the NestJS back-end. You can then access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the API

To run the API separately, use the following command:

```bash
npm run api
```

This will start the express.js development server for the API. You can then access the API endpoints by sending requests to `http://localhost:5000`.

Thank you for considering this code repository for the Gebhaly full-stack task. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact Sanusi.
